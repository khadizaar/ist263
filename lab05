    <p>
        Some of my favorite hobbies include cooking and baking. My love for baking led me to open up my own home based baking business and allowed me ti have an outlet for my creativity. It also gave me an opportunity to be my own leader and gain skills such as branding, marketing, accounting, and more!

    Although baking is my favorite hobby, I also enjoy playing sports like basketball and badminton. I also enjoy watching cooking and baking shows, my favorite obviously being the Great British Bake-Off. I plan to expand my knowledge in my experiences soon with more experience and leadership roles and more opportunities to find other creativity outlets.
